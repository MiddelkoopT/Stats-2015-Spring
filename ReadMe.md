# Engineering Statistics (IMSE 4110/7110)

## First Week

Introduction, syllabus, expectations, and overview of R.
 * Download and install R http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
   * Direct link for windows 64 bit http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.1.2-win.exe
 * Download and install RStudio http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 
   * Direct link for windows 64 bit http://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-0.98.1091.exe
 * Optional Download and install MikTeX for RStudio PDF support http://miktex.org/download/
   * Direct link for windows 64 bit http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/win32/miktex/setup/basic-miktex-2.9.5105-x64.exe
 * Optional Download and install git support http://git-scm.com/downloads/
   * Direct link for windows https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases/download/Git-1.9.5-preview20141217/Git-1.9.5-preview20141217.exe

## Using RStudio
 * Download and install the above software
 * Obtain a copy of the GitHub project by either downloading the zip (easiest), using the GitHub client (simplest when it works, press "clone in desktop"), or installing Git directly (best, clone inside RStudio).
  * To download/clone in RStudio using git select File > New Project > Version Control > Git and enter "https://github.com/MiddelkoopT/Stats-2015-Spring" in Repository URL.
 * Open RStudio and open the project (File > Open Project) and select Stats-2015-Spring/R/Stats-2015-Spring.Rproj (Windows will often hide the Rproj)

## Notes for Students

* You are an engineer not a technician.
* Work smarter not harder

Do's
* Use units (you are an engineer).
* Understand everything.
* Be Precise (sample, population)
* Think about it yourself first, try it yourself first.
* Do it yourself the first time. (tables, calculate, then use the function)
* Ask why.

Don'ts
* Don't guess.
* Don't use your calculator.
* Don't copy and paste.
* Don't reuse variable names. Just don't.

There are no stupid questions.

There are no proofs, but I expect you to understand where everything comes from (just not necessarily why)
