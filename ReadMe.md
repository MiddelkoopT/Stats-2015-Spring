## Notes for Students

* You are an engineer not a technician.
* Work smarter not harder

Do's
* Use units (you are an engineer).
* Understand everything.
* Be Precise (sample, population)
* Think about it yourself first, try it yourself first.
* Do it yourself the first time. (tables, calculate, then use the function)
* Ask why.

Don'ts
* Don't guess.
* Don't use your calculator.
* Don't copy and paste.
* Don't reuse variable names. Just don't.

There are no stupid questions.

There are no proofs, but I expect you to understand where everything comes from (just not necessarily why)
